 Key Mappings and Corresponding Functions

 U key: Executes `u_move(cube)`
 R key: Executes `d_move(cube)`
 M key: Executes `m_move(cube)`
 X key: Executes `x_move(cube)`
 Z key: Executes `z_move(cube)`

 Major Functions

1. u_move(cube): Handles the "U" (up) face move.
2. d_move(cube): Handles the "D" (down) face move.
3. m_move(cube): Handles the "M" (middle) slice move.
4. x_move(cube): Handles the "X" (rotate around Xaxis) move.
5. z_move(cube): Handles the "Z" (rotate around Zaxis) move.
6. shuffle(cycle, cube): Shuffles the Rubik's Cube.
7. solving(): Starts the Rubik's Cube solving algorithm.
8. u_first_move(cube), x_first_move(cube): Variants of moves for initial state manipulations.
9. sexy_move(cube): Executes a predefined sequence of moves known as the "sexy move".

 Additional Functionality

 Mouse Movement: Rotates the camera view based on mouse movements.
 Rendering Functions: `f_layer(cube)`, `s_layer(cube)`, `t_layer(cube)` display the different layers of the Rubik's Cube.
 Animation Functions: `u_animation`, `x_animation`, etc., animate the moves on the cube.
