3x3 Rubik's Cube in OpenGL and Python

Welcome to the 3x3 Rubik's Cube project! This project demonstrates the creation and manipulation of a 3x3 Rubik's Cube using OpenGL and Python.

Project Overview

This project simulates a 3x3 Rubik's Cube, providing interactive functionalities to rotate the cube and its individual layers. It serves as a comprehensive example of using OpenGL for computer graphics and Python for implementing the logic behind the cube's operations.

Features

- Interactive Controls: Rotate the entire cube or individual layers using keyboard inputs.
- Realistic Rendering: High-quality graphics rendering using OpenGL.
- Educational: A great learning resource for understanding 3D transformations, rotations, and OpenGL programming.

Technologies Used

- Python: The primary programming language for implementing the logic.
- OpenGL: Used for rendering the 3D graphics.
- GLUT: The OpenGL Utility Toolkit, used for handling windows and input.

Installation

To run this project, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x
- PyOpenGL
- PyOpenGL_accelerate
- GLUT (freeglut or similar)

Install the required Python packages using pip:

```sh
pip install PyOpenGL PyOpenGL_accelerate
```

Ensure you have GLUT installed. On Debian-based systems, you can install it using:

```sh
sudo apt-get install freeglut3-dev
```
 Usage

Clone this repository and navigate to the project directory:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/rubiks-cube-opengl.git
cd rubiks-cube-opengl
```

Run the main script to start the application:

```sh
python main.py
```

Controls

- Arrow Keys: Rotate the entire cube.
- R, U, F, D, L, B: Rotate the right, upper, front, down, left, and back layers respectively.
- Shift + Key: Rotate the respective layer in the opposite direction.
